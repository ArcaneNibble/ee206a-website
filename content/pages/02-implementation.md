Title: Implementation

##Lego EV3 Mindstorms Bike
For the scope of this project, we end up building a model of a E-bike using the
LEGO EV3 system. Our hardware design is borrowed with modifications from
[work](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/58231-lego-mindstorms-ev3-bike-project)
done by students at the University of Florence. On the rear wheel, we have an
EV3 "large" motor which work as the same as the hub motor of a normal E-bike. We
have a EV3 controller brick as the main processor and an EV3 "medium" motor to
actuate the steering. We removed the sonar sensor because we did not plan to
use it in our design. We also added a non-EV3 MEMS IMU, the MPU9250 from
InvenSense (now TDK), to sense the lean angle of the bike model. The hardware
design is shown below.

##MPU2950
We use an InvenSense MPU9250 9 Degree of Freedom (3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis
gyroscope, 3-axis magnetometer) IMU to measure the lean angle and its
derivative. This is labeled as the "New non-EV3 gyro" in the photo above. The
datasheet for this part can be found
[here](https://www.invensense.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PS-MPU-9250A-01-v1.1.pdf)
and the register map can be found
[here](http://www.invensense.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/RM-MPU-9250A-00-v1.6.pdf).

The reason we added a new sensor is because the sensor in the existing design
was a single-axis gyro sensor. That sensor can only measure the rate of rotation
around a single axis. Attempting to integrate this rate of rotation to calculate
an angle is prone to drift over time. However, the additional accelerometer and
magnetometer sensors in a 9DoF IMU allow for algorithms to correct for this
drift.

This device is accessed using the I2C communication protocol. Conveniently, the
predecessor to the LEGO EV3, the LEGO NXT, also used I2C to communicate with
sensors. The MPU9250 is thus easily connected to the EV3 controller brick using
the wiring diagram below.

This connection was physically made by cutting a spare LEGO EV3 cable in half
and soldering it to pin headers. The MPU9250 board is a generic board that can
be found [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I1J0Z7Y).

With this 9DoF sensor, we can easily get the derivative of the lean angle from
the gyroscope measurement on the x-axis. In this sense, the new sensor behaves
exactly the same as a single-axis gyro would.

The advantage of a 9DoF sensor appears when we try to calculate the lean angle
itself. We use the algorithm from a paper by Madgwick titled "An efficient
orientation filter for inertial and inertial/magnetic sensor arrays" to process
all data from the IMU to get a quaternion representing the orientation of the
IMU. We then calculate the lean angle from the quaternion.

The basic idea of Madgwick's algorithm is to correct the noise of gyroscope
using the values of accelerometers and magnetometers because gravitational
acceleration always points vertically towards to the ground and magnetic field
is parallel to the ground. A diagram (taken from Madgwick's paper) showing the
correction process is shown below.

Unfortunately, an issue arose when trying to use this algorithm. The amount of
magnetic interference in the environment was more significant than expected, and
this noise itself was causing the IMU orientation filter to start to drift.
Given the time constraints, we hacked the algorithm and hardcoded the
magnetometer input to the filter to be $[1, 0, 0]$. This has a side-effect of
making the algorithm always correct its quaternion output such that the
orientation it represents has the x-axis facing towards the front of the bike.
We then used this fact to more easily extract the lean angle from the
quaternion.

##Software Environment: ev3dev and Python
Instead of using the restrictive LEGO programming environment for the EV3, we
make use of a project called [ev3dev](http://www.ev3dev.org/) that has ported
a standard Debian Linux distribution to the EV3 controller. We can then program
our system in standard Python, including use of libraries such as
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/).

As a hack to slightly improve the performance of the Python controller code, the
code sets its OS-level "nice level" as low as possible.

##Simulation
Before building the hardware, we wrote a number of simple simulators to test
properties of the model. We first plot out the eigenvalues of the
uncontrolled system. Then, we check the controllability of our system to make
sure it is controllable. Finally, we run software simulation based on the
second order linearized model we used in the design part to show that the design
can actually work in theory. More details of the simulation can be found in the
"results" section.

##Implementation in Software
1. Calculate the $M$, $C_1$, $K_0$, $K_2$ matrices based on the parameters and
   pick a forward velocity(â‰ˆ0.6 m/s) for our system.
2. Calculate the $A$ and $B$ matrices and based on our parts, pick a sample rate
   (=20Hz). Using the sample rate, convert the matrices to discrete time $Ad$
   and $Bd$.
3. Using the weighting matrices $Q$ and $R$, and discrete-time
   infinite-horizon LQR algorithm to calculate the optimal proportional
   factor $K$.
4. We define the state of the system as we stated in the design part. The four
   state variables can be observed by:
    * Lean angle -- applying Magwick algorithm to the IMU values
    * Steer angle -- reading the steer motor encoder
    * Lean anglular velocity -- reading gyroscope on x-axis of the IMU
    * Steer angular velocity -- calculate the change of the steer angle and
      divide by the sampling time
5. Actuate the steer motor based on the current state and the proportional
   factor $K$.

##Deployment
We deploy the code onto the EV3 controller brick. The file will first calibrate
the sensors then apply a constant torque on the hub motor to ensure constant
velocity. Then, the LQR control is applied as stated above. A simple state
diagram of the system is shown below.
