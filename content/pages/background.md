Title: Background and motivation
Date: 2017-12-08

Recently, bike sharing programs become more and more popular worldwide. Electric bike sharing, as part of the bike
sharing market, is also growing rapidly. One problem for the E-bike sharing program is the unbalanced number of bikes at
different bike stations. This is caused by the uneven trip pattern of the bike sharing users (one-way trips, rush hour
spikes, traveler rentals). In fact, the bike sharing companies have to hire a large number of people to “rebalance”(move
bikes from one station to another) the bikes and the rebalancing operation takes up around 50% of operation cost on
average for bike sharing companies. To relief the rebalancing process, we come to the idea of making the E-bikes to
drive themselves. Our ideal goal is to let the bikes drive themselves onto and out of the truck so that much human labor
can be saved and the rebalancing process can be much more efficient. In order to achieve such goal, we first need to
balance the bike without a human rider. Thus, this project aims to build a self-balancing system for E-bikes.
