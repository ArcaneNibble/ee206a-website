Title: Background and motivation
Date: 2017-12-08

The main goal of this EE206A project was to implement a portion of the
capstone project that we are doing as part of our MEng program. The
goal of that project is to make better e-bikes.

Recently, bike sharing programs are becoming more and more popular worldwide.
Electric bike sharing, as part of the bike sharing market, is also growing
rapidly. One problem for the e-bike sharing programs is the unbalanced number of
bikes at different bike stations. This is caused by the uneven trip pattern of
the bike sharing users (e.g. one-way trips, rush hour spikes, traveler rentals).
In fact, the bike sharing companies currently have to hire a large number of
people to "rebalance" (move bikes from one station to another) the bikes and the
rebalancing operation takes up around 50% of operation cost on average for bike
sharing companies.

To relieve the rebalancing process, we came up with the idea of making the
E-bikes drive themselves. Our ideal goal is to let the bikes drive themselves
onto and out of the truck so that much human labor can be saved and the
rebalancing process can be much more efficient. In order to achieve such goal,
we first need to balance the bike without a human rider. Thus, this project aims
to build a self-balancing system for E-bikes.

In the context of EE206A, we tried to prototype self-balancing systems on a
model of an e-bike in order to explore the design space and better understand
the requirements and challenges that a self-balancing system would face.
